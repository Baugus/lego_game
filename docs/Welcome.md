## Introduction
Welcome to our game. This repository hosts development of the ruleset for our game, an open-world style game of resource management, geography, trade, and politics based around a simple, physical modeling medum: Lego Bricks. 

Initially conceived of by a group of brothers captivated by ~~arguing over the rules of~~ boardgames and their Lego collection. As we have grown, so has our old loves. What you are reading is the result of a lifelong friendship's love expressed in detailed rules and word choices :)

## In-Game Backstory
The age of humans is dawning. Humanity has discovered radical new ways to cultivate the natural landscape rather than simply exploit its bounty. Your tribe is among the first to master these techniques enabling a new, settled lifestyle and fueling a population explosion that would have been impossible as hunter-gatherers. As chief you have positioned your band to take full advantage of this technological revolution by positioning yourselves in a verdant landscape, ripe for the taking. 

But you are not alone. Other tribes have discovered this region and decided to settle down. The history of your people, of this region, and humanity will be determined by how you develop your civilization. What kind of people will you be? How will you survive and thrive in this new land? Your people will face many challenges. Only with wise and effective leadership will your civilization prosper and prevail.

Here in the cradle of civilization, your people will write the first chapter in human history. Will it be worthy of memory? 

## Object of the Game    
To become the preeminent civilization on earth. To accomplish this you must achieve the highest victory point score at the end of the age. Points are earned by building a more developed civilization than your competitors as measured in various categories. 

From humble beginnings (generally one village and a population of two) through population growth, increasing cultivation of natural resources, wise investments in infrastructure, and geographic expansion your tribe will become a regional civilization with intertwined political and economic ties to your neighbors. See [[#IV. End of the Age]] from the [[CoreRules]] for a comprehensive treatment of game end triggers and scoring.
