To be fished, a stud of water must have a worker located directly adjacent to it on an eligible piece of infrastructure (see below for list).

There are two types of trade routes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Infrastructure-Based Trade Routes: Trade routes exist along connected roads, boats, and buildings. For instance, if Village A is connected to a lake via a road, there is a sailboat on the lake, and Village B is touching a storehouse that is touching the lake, then villages A and B are connected via a general-purpose, infrastructure-based trade route and can move any resource between them subject to the usual rules on timing and blockades. Note that the sail boat does not have to be touching either the storehouse or the road for the trade route to be established. The general principle is that if two locations are connected in such a way that a worker could move between them using built infrastructure the entire way (i.e. no movement across open land), then a trade route exists between the two locations. </p> </li> <li> <p>Resource-Specific Trade Routs: By convention, trade routes for specific resources also exist through contiguous, actively cultivated harvesting areas for that resource. For example wood may move freely (as on a trade route) through any number of connected trees (9-stud footprints directly adjacent to each other), provided that they are each actively cultivated. Similarly, while wheat may not move through trees in this way, wheat can be transported through adjacent, actively cultivated, contiguous fields. </p> </li> </ul> <p>A trade route may be comprised of a combination of these two types.

Units that can project combat range (either of themselves or aided by defensive infrastructure) can restrict the movement of resources through studs within their range. For example a warrior whose range covers a road may restrict (as a passive act) the movement of resources along that road, effectively blockading that section of any trade routes that depended on road in question. This same effect exists when a unit has a combat range only because of fortification bonuses, as in the case of a worker guarding a gate. </p>"},{"location":"CoreRules/#storage-of-resources","title":"Storage of Resources","text":"<p>While resources may move freely along trade routes, they may only be stored in legal locations.

The movement of warriors is subject to all the same rules as the movement of workers as found in the #Move section. Additionally, the deploy phase is when combat can take place between unfriendly units. </p>"},{"location":"CoreRules/#combat-art-of-the-skirmish","title":"Combat: Art of the Skirmish","text":"<p>Combat is conducted during the #Deploy phase and is accomplished through skirmishes. Skirmishes are free actions, but certain conditions must be met to initiate one. When skirmishing, there are some important concepts to keep in mind.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Combat Range: Each pawn has a combat range. During a skirmish, a pawn can only \u201ctarget\u201d another pawn or detachment (see detachments below) when those targets are within their combat range. In most cases, combat range is calculated identically to movement range. There are a couple exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Trees: The combat range of a pawn in a tree is calculated from the \u201ctrunk\u201d of the tree. </p> </li> <li> <p>Fortifications:* The vertical height of a fortification is not taken into account when calculating combat range.</p> </li> <li> <p>Workers: Workers\u2019 combat range is only effective when they are garrisoned in a fortification. A worker on unimproved ground or in non-fortification infrastructure cannot exercise their combat range.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Attack/Defense Strength: Pawns have a base attack and defense strength. During a skirmish, when dice are rolled, one 6-sided dice is rolled for each pawn. Pawns score a hit when the die\u2019s result is less than or equal to their strength. </p> </li> <li> <p>Detachments: For the purposes of combat, friendly pawns stacked on the same stud are considered a detachment. Detachments are important for targeting. When a pawn in a detachment is targeted, the whole detachment is considered to be targeted. If a hit is scored, the controller of the detachment may choose any pawn from the detachment as the casualty (see casualties below). </p> </li> </ul> <p>The table below summarizes some key combat values for workers and warriors. ^6b7a99</p> Unit Combat Range Base Attack Strength Base Defense Strength Worker 2 0 0 Warrior 2 2 2 <p>Skirmishes are conducted as a sequence of steps:</p> <p>1) Declaration: Any player may declare a skirmish during, or immediately after a deploy action when at least one of their own pawns has a legal target. They do so by challenging one or more of the pawns they could legally target.   ^ed673c</p> <pre><code>1) Legal targets for the active player (the player whose turn it is) include all pawns within the effective combat range of their pawn(s) using the deploy action. For purposes of initiating a skirmish the declaring player may challenge more than one detachment.\n\n2) Legal targets for inactive players are only those pawns using the deploy action.\n\n3) When any player declares a skirmish between two or more pawns, that player is considered the declaring player. The controller(s) of the targeted pawns is the responding player(s).\n\n4) The responding player must respond with the challenged pawns, however, they may also respond with any other pawns who could target the declaring pawns.\n</code></pre> <p>3) Assign Targets: Before dice are rolled, each pawn engaged in combat must be assigned a target. If a pawn scores a hit, only pawns from the targeted detachment may be chosen as casualties. </p> <p>4) Dice Roll: Starting with the declaring player, each player in the skirmish takes a turn to roll one 6-sided dice for each of their pawns engaged in the skirmish. Players may find it prudent for clarity\u2019s sake to roll dice for all pawns with the same target at the same time, but to roll dice for pawns with different targets separately. Each kind of unit has a combat value (also called combat strength), if that units\u2019s die roll is less than or equal to its combat value, it scores a hit. Otherwise, it scores a miss. Some circumstances may increase the combat strength of a unit (e.g. fortifications), in these cases the adjusted combat value (base + bonus) is used to determine hits. All dice for all players/pawns are rolled and hits recorded before casualties are assigned. </p> <p>5) Casualties: Once each pawn has had a chance to roll a die, players must assign one casualty for each hit. Only pawns targeted by an hit can be chosen as a casualty for that hit. If all such targeted pawns have already been counted as a casualty, then the hit is not assigned. ^1cd3b     - Workers and Warriors may only be assigned one hit before they are considered a casualty. </p> <pre><code>- Pawns that become casualties are sent to \u201ccritical condition.\u201d They are removed from the board and placed into the baseplate of the nearest friendly village. See [#Critical Condition](&lt;#critical-condition&gt;) for details on what happens to pawns in critical condition.\n</code></pre> <p>6) Reaction: After causalities are taken, each player (starting with defenders) have the choice of reacting with one of the following three options:</p> <pre><code>- *Retreat:* To retreat a player moves his/her pawns one stud away from their challenging pawns. When retreating, all rules governing movement apply except the following: (1) a vertical distance of at most one stud may be ignored and (2) no bonuses due to infrastructure (roads, boats, etc.) are counted. *Note: Given the particulars of board geography and movement rules, retreat is not always possible.*\n\n- *Complete the Deploy:* If this skirmish interrupted a deploy action of the active player (i.e. the player whose turn it is) then that player may choose to complete any remaining studs of movement afforded by their deploy action. Only move to step 6 once all remaining studs of the deployment action are completed.\n\n- *Re-deploy:* The active player may choose to initiate another deploy action. Step 6 may be initiated by either player at any point during this new deploy action. ^868a68\n</code></pre> <p>7) Press the Attack: Once any responses have been completed (or started in the case of a re-deployment), a new round of skirmishing may be initiated, as a free action, by any of the skirmishing parties provided the rules governing declaration are met. If neither player choses to make a reaction, a new skirmish may be initiated immediately as a free action.</p> <p>Skirmishing rounds end only when all players able to press the attach choose to not do so or none of the parties are able to continue pressing the attack (e.g. all unfriendly pawns have taken casualties or retreated).</p> <p>Note that an initial skirmish may only be declared when a deploy action is taken. This means that a worker alone can never be used by the active player to initiate a skirmish. Workers may only challenge the active player\u2019s deploying warriors. Additionally, two unfriendly warriors that begin the deployment phase within range of each other, cannot initiate a skirmish unless one of them initiates a deploy action. Once a skirmish is declared, subsequent skirmishes can be initiated immediately between the same detachments, but the initial skirmish cannot be declared without a deploy action used by one of the engaged parties.</p>"},{"location":"CoreRules/#plunder","title":"Plunder","text":"<p>When a pawn chosen as a casualty has resources they are temporarily storing during the round, those resources must be immediately gathered by another pawn, or forfeited.
